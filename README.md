  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>Not long ago, I was working as a technical support expert for automated equipment in clinical laboratories. Eventually, I decided it was time for a new challenge, software egineering has always got my attention, so I decided to start a career as a web developer - and it's one of the best choices I've ever made.<br>
    <br>
    This journey has only begun but I'm already enjoying every moment and learning fascinating things. Already had experience finding effective solutions to different kinds of problems, and that's what a web developer does, in my opinion.<br>
    <br>
    My goal is to become a professional software engineer and contribute to create meaningful software from web and mobile apps to videogames.</p>

<h4>Recent project</h4>
<div>
  <br>
  <p>On this project I used JavaScript, CSS, HTML, API REST and NodeJS to create<br>
  a responsive web app.</p>
  <p>The use of JS classes and API REST was aessential to complete the project and keep it<br>
  working the way it was meant to be. I learned the importance and utility of JS classes to maintain<br>
  a well-structured codebase.</p>

<h5>Other projects</h5>
<div>
  <br>
  <p>These were two of my first proejcts, where I practiced HTML and CSS. The goal was to<br>
  create a resposive model.</p>
  <p>This web page is meant to be properly seen in different devices, such as<br>
    tablets, smartphones an desktop computers, to achieve this, the use of media queries<br>
  was the key. I'd like to highlight that on these projects were implemented the use<br>
    of flexbox and grid, this helped me realize the pros and cons of each one,<br>
    so now I know better when and where to use them.</p>
