  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>Not long ago, I was working as a technical support expert for automated equipment in clinical laboratories. Eventually, I decided it was time for a new challenge, software egineering has always got my attention, so I decided to start a career as a web developer - and it's one of the best choices I've ever made.<br>
    <br>
    This journey has only begun but I'm already enjoying every moment and learning fascinating things. Already had experience finding effective solutions to different kinds of problems, and that's what a web developer does, in my opinion.<br>
    <br>
    My goal is to become a professional software engineer and contribute to create meaningful software from web and mobile apps to videogames.</p>
